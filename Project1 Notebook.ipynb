    "Choosing the right data set for to perform multiple types of tests across different types of data can be a challenge.  There needs to be sufficient variables, more than 30 is a good base, and about 25,000 rows of data.  The variables should include a combination of continuous and categorical variables in order to run regression or classification models.  \n",
    "We decided to work with The Belk Foundation data sets from 2014 to 2017.  These data sets encompass information across 4 continuous years of educational attributes in North Carolina, USA.  For the purpose of this exercise our focus is around school performance on different types  of characteristics like  schools, type of school, social demographic, economic demographics, location and school category within 2014-2017.  The Belk Foundation's website says, \"Our goal is to empower todayâ€™s workforce by creating pathways to and through postsecondary education for underrepresented students\". For the sake of this analysis, we assume that better performing schools have better outcomes in postsecondary education. With North Carolina's rapidly-changing demographics, it is important to take into consideration schools' unique needs when allocating funds to strategic investment initiatives. Here, we explore where funding can be best applied based to educational achievement data.\n",
    "In order to achieve this goal, we will explore through visual and mathematical modeling which features best predict the School Performance Grade (SPG), a measure of a school's overall success based on test scores and growth measures. "
